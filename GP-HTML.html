	<p>Stress and strain are directly proportional to each other by a factor called Young’s Modulus of Elasticity<sup>1</sup> which is a material property, and can be seen visually in the Stress-Strain Diagram show below.</p>
	<!-- Stress Strain Diagram Here -->
	<p>If only pulled apart slightly and then released, then the molecules will be return to their normal unstressed state. This is called an elastic deformation. Pulled too far apart, and there can be irreparable damage done to the material, often stretching and elongating – this is called plastic deformation. When these molecules are pulled even further apart the material will fracture and break into separate pieces.<sup>2</sup></p>
